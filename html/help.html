                <p>This is how the app works.</p>
                <p>Ocon Music analysis app works very straight foroward:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Step 1: click on the analysis button.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Step 2: Select the audio file that you want to make an analysis.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Step 3: Wait until the graphics show up (It might take a while).</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Done</p>
                <p></p>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveform" alt="wikipedia waveform link">Waveform</a>
                <p>
                    The waveform of an audio is a graphical representation of the sound signal over time. It shows the amplitude (loudness) of the sound wave on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis. The waveform provides information about the characteristics of the sound such as its frequency, duration, and intensity. The shape of the waveform can also provide clues about the quality of the sound, such as the presence of distortion or noise.</p>

                <p>
                    A melody spectrogram of an audio is a visual representation of the frequency content of an audio signal over time, with emphasis on the frequency content that corresponds to the pitch of the music. It can be used to identify the pitch of individual notes or chords, and to visualize the overall melodic structure of a piece of music. Melody spectrograms are created by applying a Fourier transform to the audio signal and then mapping the resulting frequency content onto a two-dimensional plot, with time on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Color can be used to represent the amplitude or power of the frequency content at each point in time and frequency.</p>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-Q_transform" alt="wikipedia Constant-Q transform link">Constant-Q transform</a>
                <p>The Constant-Q Transform (CQT) is a type of Fourier transform used in digital signal processing to analyze audio signals. It is similar to the more commonly used Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), but uses a different frequency scale that is more aligned with the way humans perceive sound.
                </p><p>
                    The CQT divides the frequency spectrum into a series of logarithmically spaced frequency bins, with each bin having a bandwidth proportional to its center frequency. This means that low-frequency bins are wider than high-frequency bins, reflecting the way that the human ear is more sensitive to changes in pitch at lower frequencies.
                </p><p>
                    The CQT is particularly useful for analyzing musical signals, as it can be used to identify musical notes and chords, and to extract features such as spectral harmonics and onset times. It is also used in applications such as speech recognition, noise reduction, and audio compression.
